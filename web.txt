How does the Internet work?

The Internet is made up of a many, many local networks that come together to form a very big netowrk. All machines and sites on the Internet are identified by an IP address. For websites, this IP address is translated to a easier-to-remember domain name by the DNS. These domain names then become part of a URL, which are composed of its protocal, hostname, port, and resource. A protocal allows one machine to talk to another, and is usually either http:// or https://, the "s" denoting that the site is secure. The hostname is the domain name, and resolves to an IP address. The port is a unique location in a server for your machine to communicate with, the default being 8 on most http:// sites and 443 on most https:// sites. Finally, a resource denotes a specific page on a site. This is sometimes stores on a seperate file in its server.

When you click on link, you are sending the intitial request by essentially using a cURL command in your browser. When the request reaches the server, the application will execute it's code. The browser will receive the HTML and process it, and the page will be rendered in the browser. Before it reaches out to the root DNS servers to retreive the information, it will first check your machine's local DNS cache if you have visited the page before. If it doesn't find anything there, it will then check your local router DNS, and then your IPS DNS before reaching out through the internet to retreive the information from the root DNS server.
